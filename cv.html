      <h5>Experience</h5>

      <p><i>Research associate</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2018-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>
        <br>Stanford University, Arizona State University, Carnegie Institution for Science
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm applying deep learning to remote sensing data in order to build a global map of coral reefs and monitor reef areas for ecological changes. Our group was initially affiliated with Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution for Science, and is now affiliated with Arizona State University.

      <p><i>Data science consultant</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2016-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>
        <br>Independent
      </p>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>CTO</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2016-2017</span>
        <br>ERA Economics
      </p>

      <p>California's agricultural output is worth billions of dollars and feeds communities around the world. As CTO at ERA Economics, I was responsible for communicating the analytical and technical vision for growing our consultancy, balancing business needs with the resources available for technical development, and developing a healthy internal culture.
      <ul class="list-styled">
        <li>Developed new data products, e.g., created risk reports to quantify and communicate economic, water, and other agricultural risks</li>
        <li>Updated data management practices, e.g., created a system to automate existing analyses and make new analyses possible</li>
      <li>Actively provided professional development opportunities for younger colleagues and involved team members in business decisions</li>
      </ul>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Senior software engineer / data scientist</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2016-2016</span>
        <br>Sourceress
      </p>

      <p>Software engineers receive innumerable unsolicited emails from tech recruiters for irrelevant positions. As the first engineer at Sourceress, I worked to connect mission-driven startups with skilled employees who cared deeply about those missions, particularly in areas like education, health care, and biological research.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Created the foundational back- and front-end infrastructure for internal analytics</li>
          <li>Assessed candidate fit using statistical and machine learning models, especially with natural language processing</li>
          <li>Helped the CEO and CTO to make critical business decisions by creating internal dashboards and reports to surface various metrics</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Senior data scientist / software engineer</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2014-2016</span>
        <br>Farmers Business Network
      </p>

      <p>Farmers are often forced to make crucial business decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information. As the first data scientist at FBN, I identified critical agronomic knowledge gaps, aggregated a variety of relevant public and private datasets, and created data products that help farmers make informed decisions. Because we were an early-stage startup, analytics were only one small aspect of my contribution; I also built hardened production processes and created powerful visualization tools.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Constructed national weather data pipeline and model to facilitate decision-making</li>
          <li>Developed data cleaning algorithm to curate reliable agronomic records</li>
          <li>Created mapping service to clean, visualize, and communicate spatial insights</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Researcher</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2007-2014</span>
        <br>UW Madison and UC Davis
      </p>
      
      <p>I used mathematical models, network theory, and machine learning algorithms to understand how anthropogenic changes influence complex ecological systems. I was fortunate to work on a wide variety of systems, participate in a series of working groups, and collaborate closely with brilliant individuals from around the globe. Together, we produced over 15 papers and data resources.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Analyzed mathematical models to measure the effect of climatological changes on species interactions</li>
          <li>Applied network theory to ecological community data to quantify structure, dynamics, and stability</li>
          <li>Used numerical simulations and machine learning to explore ecosystem health under various climatological scenarios</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h5>Education</h5>
      <p><i>Ph.D. in Quantitative Ecology</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2009-2014</span>
        <br>University of California, Davis
      </p>

      <p><i>B.S. in Mathematics and Economics</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2004-2009</span>
        <br>University of Wisconsin, Madison
