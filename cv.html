      <h5>Education</h5>
      <p><i>Ph.D. in Quantitative Ecology</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2009-2014</span>
        <br>University of California, Davis
      </p>
      
      <p><i>B.S. in Mathematics and Economics</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2004-2009</span>
        <br>University of Wisconsin, Madison
      </p>

      <h5>Experience</h5>
      <p><i>Data science consultant</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2016-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>
        <br>Independent
      </p>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Software engineer</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2016-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>
        <br>Sourceress
      </p>

      <p>Software engineers receive innumerable unsolicited emails from tech recruiters for irrelevant positions. As the first engineer at Sourceress, I worked to connect mission-driven startups with skilled employees who cared deeply about those missions, particularly in areas like education, health care, and biological research.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Created the foundational back- and front-end infrastructure for internal analytics</li>
          <li>Assessed candidate fit using statistical and machine learning models, especially with natural language processing</li>
          <li>Helped the CEO and CTO to make critical business decisions by creating internal dashboards and reports to surface various metrics</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Senior data scientist</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2014-2016</span>
        <br>Farmers Business Network
      </p>

      <p>Farmers are often forced to make crucial business decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information. As the first data scientist FBN, I identified critical agronomic knowledge gaps, aggregated a variety of relevant public and private datasets, and created data products that help farmers make informed decisions. Because we were an early-stage startup, analytics were only one small aspect of my contribution; I also built hardened production processes and created powerful visualization tools.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Constructed national weather data pipeline and model to facilitate decision-making</li>
          <li>Developed data cleaning algorithm to curate reliable agronomic records</li>
          <li>Created mapping service to clean, visualize, and communicate spatial insights</li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>

      <p><i>Researcher</i>
        <span style="float:right;">2007-2014</span>
        <br>UW Madison and UC Davis
      </p>
      
      <p>I used mathematical models, network theory, and machine learning algorithms to understand how anthropogenic changes influence complex ecological systems. I was fortunate to work on a wide variety of systems, participate in a series of working groups, and collaborate closely with brilliant individuals from around the globe. Together, we produced over 15 papers and data resources.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Analyzed mathematical models to measure the effect of climatological changes on species interactions</li>
          <li>Applied network theory to ecological community data to quantify structure, dynamics, and stability</li>
          <li>Used numerical simulations and machine learning to explore ecosystem health under various climatological scenarios</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h5>Analytics</h5>
      <p>As a data scientist, I've learned and implemented analytical skills as needed, with the goal of providing value accurately and quickly. I have real world knowledge and experience in the following topics and more.
        <ul class="list-styled">
          <li>Probability, linear algebra, deterministic and stochastic analyses, matrix models, integral-projection models, sensitivity analyses, network structure and dynamics</li>
          <li>Frequentist and Bayesian statistics; Linear, logistic, and polynomial regression, splines, and GAMs; fixed and random effects; time series analysis</li>
          <li>LDA, QDA, KNN, SVM, PCA, k-means, hierarchical clustering, random forests, naive bayes</li>
          <li>Variable and feature selection, standardization, regularization; Training and testing, cross-validation, ROC, boosting and bagging, Markov chains</li>
          <li>Natural language processing</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h5>Engineering</h5>
      <p>I use a variety of languages, tools, and best practices to communicate my results.

          <li>Python, R, JavaScript, Matlab, Mathematica, Bash, HTML, CSS</li>
          <li>AWS (EC2, S3, SQS, SES, EB, CF)</li>
          <li>Version control (Git), Databases (MySQL, PSQL) and datacubes; Message queues (SQS, RabbitMQ, Redis); Containerization and virtualization (Docker, VirtualBox)</li>
          <li>Profiling; Testing and testing services (CircleCI); Logging and logging services (Loggly, Sentry), monitoring (DataDog, custom)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
