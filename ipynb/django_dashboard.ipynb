    "# First steps to creating a Django dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "I generate my own plots with R or Python, typically with ggplot or matplotlib, although I've sometimes used other libraries or even Javascript and D3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I needed to create an internal dashboard for an organization to track various metrics. I looked into options like Tableau and Plotly, but realized I didn't like 1) paying for something I could do easily, 2) adding additional data formatting steps, or 3) having all the bells and whistles. Instead, I just modified my existing visualization workflow to serve plots via Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we're going to have a URL linked to a view that returns a figure, and a template with an image link to that URL. Yeah, this isn't earth-shattering, but it's so much easier to do this when you're already creating visualizations and working within a Django project, and I'd like to remember how to do this in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate the figure\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I have an analytics module in my Django project, and I added a visualizations script to create figures. In that script, I need to import matplotlib and configure the backend:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import matplotlib\n",
    "matplotlib.use('Agg')\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within that script, I need to create a function to generate a figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def create_figure():\n",
    "    {magic}\n",
    "    return figure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate the dashboard template\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I create a template at main/templates/dashboard.html that displays visualizations, although it can certainly be cleaned up with a framework like Bootstrap:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n",
    "\n",
    "{% block content %}\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Sample visualization</h1>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{% url 'DashboardVisualizations' %}\">\n",
    "\n",
    "{% endblock %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create view to handle requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we need to create a view for the dashboard and a view for the dashboard visualizations. The former returns the webpage, while the later returns the figure. Thus, we create a script called main/views/dashboards.py with this content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg\n",
    "\n",
    "import main.analytics.visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dashboard(TemplateView):\n",
    "\n",
    "    template_name = 'main/templates/dashboard.html'  # This was our template filename\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Context can be used to modify dashboard or figure content\n",
    "        context = {'sample_key': 'sample_context'}\n",
    "        return context\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class DashboardVisualizations(View):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # The following function is from our visualization script\n",
    "        figure = visualizations.create_figure()  \n",
    "        canvas = FigureCanvasAgg(figure)\n",
    "        response = HttpResponse(content_type='image/png')\n",
    "        canvas.print_png(response)\n",
    "        return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure URLs to handle requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to create a URL for both the dashboard and the visualizations so that requests are routed to the correct views.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# We import the views from our view script\n",
    "from main.views.dashboards import Dashboard, DashBoardVisualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    url(r'dashboard/', Dashboard.as_view()),\n",
    "    url(r'dashboard/sample_plot/', DashboardVisualizations.as_view()),\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you just need to navigate to projectname.com/dashboard to see the figures!"
