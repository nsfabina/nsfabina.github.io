    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2015 primary season is in full-swing and plenty of attention is being given to the two main Democratic candidates, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Although there are clear differences between Sanders and Clinton, I thought it would be interesting to try to quantify those differences, and explore whether those differences were correlated with any meaningful characteristics. This actually seems like a pretty simple project, given the numerous efforts to open up government records and the tools available to evaluate this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exploration, we're going to use the <a href=\"https://govtrack.us\"><b>GovTrack.us API</b></a> to access information on Sanders, Clinton, and other Senators. As an overview, we're going to access Senator identifying information and voting records, convert that raw data into useful structures, and calculate and compare similarity metrics, much as we would for social network analysis or recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Accessing Senator information\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to pull a comprehensive list of Senators to analyze. I arbitrarily decided that I wanted to compare Senators that served after January 01, 2000, and I wanted to restrict the analysis to Senators that served for at least two years. Without confirming whether these constraints are useful, I wanted to avoid potential issues with temporal voting trends and changing political climates, as well as Senators that served for a short amount of time and have \"outlier\" voting records. With that in mind, we can pull identifying information for each Senator, including their GovTrack ID, name, party, state, and gender."
