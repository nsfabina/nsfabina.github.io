  <p>I'm a data scientist with a broad skillset. The engineering know-how that can take a project from nothing to a containerized production process with monitoring, logging, and testing. The data science trifecta of mathematics, statistics, and machine learning backgrounds. The communication skills to clearly describe or visualize critical insights.
I want to be challenged, to create solutions that lead to tangible and positive outcomes, to work with colleagues who are passionate about a shared goal.</p>

  <p>Currently, I'm a data scientist with Farmers Business Network, where we work to improve quality-of-life for farmers. Right now, farmers are forced to make crucial business decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information. At FBN, we identify critical agronomic knowledge gaps, aggregate a variety of relevant public and private datasets, and create data products that help farmers make informed decisions. Since we're a startup, stats and machine learning are only one small aspect of my contribution; I also build hardened production processes and create intuitive visualization tools.</p>

  <p>In my previous role as a researcher, I used mathematical models, network theory, and machine learning algorithms to understand how anthropogenic changes influence complex ecological systems. I was lucky to have collaborated with a diverse group of brilliant individuals, both empirically and quantitatively gifted, from academia, industry, and government. Together, we created over 15 papers and data products. To summarize almost a decade of work, we showed that the stability of plant-pollinator systems is a function of the timing and intensity of interactions, that coral symbioses may be more diverse and complex than previously expected, and that the resilience of coral reef ecosystems are dependent on an interplay between life-cycle dynamics and environmental disturbances.</p>
